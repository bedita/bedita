# BEdita, a semantic content management framework

## Developer preview

This is an early developer preview branch where we test new CakePHP 3 features and others.
To install you have to use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).

Once you have installed composer clone repository and checkout the right branch, then

```bash
$ cd /my/bedita/folder
$ composer install
```

It will install all necessary dependencies to startup BEdita. After that when you want to update vendor libs

```bash
$ cd /my/bedita/folder
$ composer update
```

In `config/app.php` edit the `$config['Datasources']['default']` array with your database connection data.

NB. For now the db has to be initialized using schema and data in 3.4.0 or greater version

BEdita is a software to create, manage content and organize it with semantic rules.
BEdita is a modular framework that features a back-end Content Management System out-of-the-box.
It is an integrated environment that inherits all the features of the libraries and tools it includes,
like [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/), [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/).

BEdita is flexible and may fit many projects thanks to its MVC / Object Oriented design,
its multi-tier architecture and through the abstraction of semantic relations.
