                          A Quick Howto
               ======================================


BEdita comes with a web wizard install procedure.

below).



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 BEFORE INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minimum requirements must be satisfied.
Your server should have at least have:

    * 20 Megabytes of disk space for the base installation.
    * Apache 2

with the source package.



DOWNLOAD BEdita

You can download the latest release (stable or development) from:

 http://www.bedita.com/download




INSIDE THE PACKAGE

The expanded package contains a root folder called "bedita" containing all files and folders.
A few files are just inside this folder:

- INSTALL - this setup guide
- README.md - contains a brief BEdita explanation and some useful links
- LICENSE.LGPL - the LGPL license
- CHANGES - is a log of latest changes
- CONTRIBUTING.md - explains how you can contribute to improve BEdita


The root directory also contains the following:

- addons
  addon modules extending BEdita (models, shell scripts, components…)

- bedita-app
  the core, deployed as a CakePHP application

- cake
  contains the CakePHP framework: DO NOT manually upgrade CakePHP, since the distribution
  is verified with this particular version

- frontends
  preferred directory for front end applications (front web sites)

- modules
  plugin modules (BEdita extension plugins)

- setup
  only used for setup web wizard, not part of the actual application

- vendors
  third party libraries, i.e. Smarty template engine and others




CREATE THE DATABASE

Be sure you already have a MySQL database you can use with BEdita.
PostgreSQL should work as well, but it's not intensively tested.
The database will be completely EMPTIED during setup.
The SQL User should have GRANTS on data and structure (INSERT, DELETE... and CREATE, DROP...).




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 WEB WIZARD INSTALL (recommended)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- download BEdita (see up)
- unpack the package and copy the root folder "bedita" into a web reachable directory
  on your server
- make sure you have all necessary information to access your database: server address,
  name of the database and credentials (username and password)
- point your web browser to the relative URL address (www.example.com/bedita)
- follow the steps: the wizard will guide you throughout the process of configuring BEdita




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MANUAL INSTALL FROM COMMAND LINE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Configure the database credentials in database.php

CD to the "config" directory: this directory is located inside the "bedita-app" folder.
Edit the file "database.php" and insert proper values for elements in the $default array.
Usually a few basic values are needed for host, login, password and database.



2. Verify filesystem permissions

The directory defined in $config['mediaRoot'] must be writable by the web server.
Verify also that the bedita-app/tmp directory is recursively writable by the web server (this
directory contains caches and logs).



3. Shell script bedita init

Tha database and BEdita need to be initialized.
On the command line cd to your install directory (inside the "bedita" folder, containing the
file "cake.sh").
type and execute the following command:

 ./cake.sh bedita init

At the end of the script you will be asked to command a new system status check. Just press "y".



4. Access the system

Point your browser to the location of your BEdita install.
You will redirected to the login page!
If you see a page displayed without styles or blank you could have issues with apache mod_rewrite settings. See the documentation at http://docs.bedita.com/setup/handling-mod_rewrite-in-bedita-and-cakephp for more details.

Use the following credentials for the very first access:
username: bedita
password: bedita

Just change your password in the Admin module.

That's it.
